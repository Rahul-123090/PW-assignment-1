        "\n",
        "Ans. A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where you don’t know the exact number of iterations in advance, and the loop needs to continue running until a certain condition is met. This makes it ideal for situations where the loop is based on dynamic or user-defined conditions that can change during the execution of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario: Asking for Valid User Input\n",
        "Let’s say you’re creating a program that asks a user to input their age, and you want to ensure that the input is a valid number (greater than 0). If the user provides invalid input, the program should continue asking until a valid age is entered. This is a situation where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop because you don't know how many times the user will provide invalid input, and you only want to stop when a valid response is received.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "age = -1  # Initialize to an invalid age\n",
        "\n",
        "while age <= 0:\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n",
        "        if age <= 0:\n",
        "            print(\"Age must be a positive number. Please try again.\")\n",
        "    except ValueError:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",

        "print(f\"Thank you! Your age is {age}.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "The while loop runs as long as the condition age <= 0 is True, meaning it will keep asking for the user's age until a valid positive number is provided.\n",
        "The loop checks if the entered age is greater than 0. If not, it will continue prompting the user for a valid input.\n",
        "The loop doesn't know how many iterations it will take because the number of attempts depends on when the user provides a valid response.\n",
        "Why a while Loop Is Suitable Here:\n",
        "Uncertain Number of Iterations: You don’t know in advance how many times the user might give an invalid input. A while loop will continue asking for input until a valid value is provided.\n",
        "Dynamic Condition: The condition (age <= 0) changes based on user input, making a while loop the ideal choice because the loop will run until the condition is no longer True.\n",
        "This scenario is an excellent example of when a while loop is more suitable than a for loop, as the number of iterations is not known and is dependent on external input.\n",
